    <div class = "engineering_explore_texts">
        Bioengineering is a relatively new discipline that combines many aspects of traditional engineering fields such as chemical, electrical and mechanical engineering. Examples of bioengineering include: artificial hips, knees and other joints. ultrasound, MRI and other medical imaging techniques

            <div class = "biotextheader">What do BioMedical Engineers do?</div>
            <div class = textblock1>
            Biomedical engineers typically do the following:
            </div>
        <ul>
            <li>Design biomedical equipment and devices e.g. Artificial organs</li>
            <li>Replacements for body parts</li>
            <li>Design machines for diagnosing medical problems</li>
        </ul>
        Overall their prupose if to install, adjust, maintain, repair, or provide technical support for biomedical equipment.

        <div class = "textblock1">
            <div>Jobs in BioMed are much more focused as it is a new field of engineering, some example include:</div>
        </div>
        <ul>
            <li>Analytical chemist</li>
            <li>Biomedical scientist</li>

        <div class = "biotextheader">Brief history of BioMed Engineering</div>
        
        The practice of biomedical engineering has a long history. One of the earliest examples is a wood and leather prosthetic toe found on a 3,000-year-old Egyptian mummy. Before that, even simple crutches and walking sticks were a form of engineered assistive devices, and the first person to fashion a splint for a broken bone could be considered to have been an early biomedical engineer.
        
        <div>As technology progressed so did the field of Biomedical engineering:</div>
        The works of Alexander Graham Bell and Thomas Edison on sound transmission and amplification in the late 19th and early 20th centuries were applied to make the first tabletop hearing aids.
